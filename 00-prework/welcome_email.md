SUBJECT:
Welcome to Metis! (and some first steps)

BODY:
Hello, and welcome to the Metis Data Science Bootcamp!

I'm Aaron, and Bo and I will be your instructors. We are very fortunate to also be joined by Reshama, Paul, and Trevor, who will be your teaching assistants.

We're all very excited about getting to know you and working with you over the next three invigorating months!

There are a few steps you can take now to get things off to a great start, and we've organized them around filling in your information in a Google Sheet:

[Fill in your information here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12BZEXEcu4mmkWaM4_54Wp7FGmzWBBn_86WjuCIJ0jO8/edit?usp=sharing)

Here are details on how to fill in your information:

 * Name: Please ensure this includes your preferred spoken name. *If you change this field, please let us know and we will update our address books.*
 * Email: Please ensure this is your preferred email address. *If you change this field, please let us know and we will update our address books.*
 * Birthday: You don't have to tell us if you don't want to, but then how will we know when to wish you a happy birthday?
 * Discourse username: If you don't have a Discourse account yet, you need to get one. Go to [discourse.thisismetis.com](http://discourse.thisismetis.com/) and “Sign Up”, then let us know and we will approve your account.
 * Slack username: You will receive an invite for the [Metis Slack](https://metis-dsbc.slack.com/). Set it up, and you will have a username. Our main channel is `03_spring_2015`.
 * GitHub account URL: You need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If you don't yet have one, you'll have to make one. It's easy and free.
 * LinkedIn account URL: You need to have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) account (just ask Megan and Lillian, our talent placement team). If you don't yet have one, you'll have to make one. It's easy and free.
 * Twitter account URL: You don't *need* to be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), necessarily, but it does expand your communication options, so we recommend that you have an account.
 * Blog URL: Blogging is good for you. If you have a blog, put its address here. You'll create a blog in the first week of the bootcamp, so if you don't have one yet, don't sweat it.

We hope you've been doing [preparatory work](https://github.com/thisismetis/dsprework); continue doing so, and we'll go over how to submit it in our first week. As always, feel free to email any of us with questions. 

See you soon!

~ Aaron, Bo, Reshama, Paul, and Trevor
