### Luther Brainstorming Guide

Luther will be an individual project. Still, we will brainstorm in
groups, so that you can build upon each other's ideas and generate a
lot of potential directions. After that, you each will decide for
yourselves which of these directions to take.

Break into groups of 3-4. There will be three sections of
brainstorming: Potential Clients, Questions, and Possible
Inputs. We'll have 15 minutes to discuss each section.


## Potential Clients

 * Movie studio
 * Movie futures investment firm
 * Producer
 * Marketing company


## Questions we might answer for clients using data

 * Given potential movies to make, what movies should I make?
 * Given movies that are being made, which movies should I invest in?
 * Given movies that are being made, where should I allocate my
 marketing budget?
 * Can I predict the profitability of movies that are about to be
 released?
 * Can I predict the eventual/total/longer term profitability of movies
 that have just been released?
 * Can I predict international success?
 * Can I predict what movies will be "cult classics"?
