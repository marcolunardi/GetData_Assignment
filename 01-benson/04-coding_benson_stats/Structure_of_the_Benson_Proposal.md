####Structure of the Benson Proposal
Proposals do not have very rigid structures and many differ from each
other. Keep in short: ~ 2 pages is a good rule of thumb. Most clients
won't be super excited by the prospect of reading a 19 page
report. Avoid dry, passive voices. Don't put any code in. You want to
excite them. Keep in mind that they are not data scientists, so keep
the level high and not too technical.

Here are _very general_ guidelines:

You can start with a very brief (2-3 sentences) problem statement,
defining the question you're attacking. Then you can describe what
immediate insights you pulled out of an initial, simple exploration of
the mta data. You can put in a few graphs.

Then you can go into your plans of getting external data and analysis
to help them solve their problem. You can put a sketch or two in
there, or not, up to you. And you're done!
