## Some External Reading

###Probability

 * _A First Course in Probability_, S. Ross, 9th ed. (2012)
  * older editions are also fine.
  
### Bayesian Probability, Inference, and Analysis

 * _Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial_, D. Sivia, J. Skilling (2006)
  * Introductory and practical, teaches everything with examples, but definitely not mathless. Great book.
 
 * _Bayesian Data Analysis_, A. Gelman, et al. 2nd ed. (2003)
  * Assumes a healthy amount of statistical background.

###Mathematical Statistics

 * _Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis_, J. Rice, 3rd ed. (2006)
  * older editions are also probably fine.
  * proof-heavy. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and linear algebra is assumed
  * includes introductions to all sorts of distributions, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation

###Linear Regression

 * _Basic Econometrics_, D. Guajarati and D. Porter, 5th ed. (2008)
  * with minimal calculus/linear algebra
  * relevant chapters to lectures are Ch. 1 - Ch. 13
  * older editions are also fine.
  * Datascope has a copy here. You can borrow this book during the day, or for an evening.
  
* _Linear Models with R_, J. Faraway, 1st ed. (2004)
 * short, dense book with examples in R
 * relevant chapters to lectures are Ch. 1 - Ch. 8, Ch. 9.2-9.3, Ch. 11
 * familiarity with multivariate calculus and linear algebra is assumed

###Machine Learning

 * _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_, C.M. Bishop (2007)
  * **The** Machine Learning book. Bayesian viewpoint. Large coverage. Ugly cover.
  * Heavy enough for use as a murder weapon
  * We have two copies here. You can borrow this book during the day, or for an evening.

  
* _Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective_, K.P. Murphy (2012)
 * MIT's take on machine learning. Intuitive, uses lots of examples.
 * Self contained, no need for another machine learning book
 * You can also murder with this one
 * We have two copies here. You can borrow this book during the day, or for an evening.
 
* _Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)_, T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, J. Friedman, 2nd ed. (2009)
 * Another Machine Learning classic. Calculus and Linear algebra are assumed.
 * The pdf is freely available online: http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/
 
###Categorical Data Analysis (Logistic regression, GLMs, etc.)

* _Categorical Data Analysis_, A. Agresti, 3rd ed. (2012)
 * Previous ed. (2nd) good too
 * On the dense/mathy side, but it is a good reference for GLMs, especially Ch. 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
 * Agresti also has great, though terse lecture notes from [one of his classes][1]

* GLM Notes from a Princeton class
 * http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/
 * Clear lecture notes, relatively digestible for all main topics related to GLM
